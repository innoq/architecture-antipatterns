<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>An insurance company developed a large and complex system to handle its life insurance policies. Due to the mixture of different technologies and paradigms, the system got very hard to maintain. The deployment cyle of 6 month was much too long for business requirements.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-systems-background">What is the system’s background?</h2>
<p>The system had already been in production for about a decade and the current size of the maintenance team was about 100 people working full-time.</p>

<p>Insurance policies have a very long life cycle, typically spanning decades. In fact it’s quite normal for a system like this to never have its data migrated once a successor has been built; instead, you simply keep it running until all the policies handled by it are terminated (i.e., everyone has been paid out because they reached retirement age – or died).</p>

<p>The system had numerous connections to the outside world via integrations. Furthermore, it had a GUI client for internal staff, built using SmallTalk. The client communicated to a mainframe system via the CICS transaction monitor, where the core database and policy life-cycle logic was implemented in COBOL. The core premium calculation component was built in C++ because of an existing library. It was shared with both, SmallTalk client and mainframe.</p>

<p>A model-driven design was used. An UML model for the contracts was maintained with IBM Rational® Rose. Code for the serialization in the DB2 was generated with a self written mapper. Futhermore, the objects of the C++ and SmallTalk client were generated with a self written OO mapper. The model was used for the communication between the three components of the system as well.</p>

<p>The SmallTalk team knew object oriented (OO) programing and pushed the use of OO in the non OO world of COBOL. (Knowledge Tunnelling)</p>

<h2 id="what-were-the-good-ideas">What were the good ideas?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Writing the GUI client with SmallTalk in that time was state of the art.</li>
  <li>Buying and using an existing software written in C++ for the premium calculation instead of writing it from scratch.</li>
  <li>Common concepts and patterns shared in the components of a system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-were-the-bad-consequences-why-was-everything-bad">What were the bad consequences, why was everything bad?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The time to develop features was too high because: The Model-driven approach created a massive centralization bottleneck (only two weeks of a six-month cycle to make model changes). There was just one person able to make those changes.</li>
  <li>The pressure to get features implemented led to “re-use” of existing attributes for other purposes. These attributes had to be renamed in the next release cycle. (Failing Rigidity)</li>
  <li>The attempt to create an OO environment in COBOL created performance issues for batch processing.</li>
  <li>Objects changed. Therefore, already serialized objects needed to be migrated to newer object versions.</li>
  <li>High maintenance costs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happened-was-there-a-turning-or-tipping-point">What happened, was there a turning or tipping point?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The self written OO system led to high complexity and caused more problems than it solved.</li>
  <li>The highly proprietary custom object structures led to integration problems. (Knowledge Tunnelling)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-could-the-situation-be-resolved">How could the situation be resolved?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We would suggest to introduce a more flexible key-value store in the model as a short-term patch.</li>
  <li>In the long run, we would modulerise the system into easier to maintain sub-systems based on bounded contexts (e.g. Domain Driven Design). The new sub-systems would not share a common model anymore. Each sub-system would maintain its own model (Self Contained Systems). Smaller teams could work on single components independently with shorter release cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-avoid-such-a-situation">How to avoid such a situation?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not use a common data model in multiple sub-systems.</li>
  <li>Do not write OO mappers yourself.</li>
  <li>Do not use OO mappers when you don’t need to.</li>
  <li>Avoid organizational bottlenecks.</li>
  <li>Release often. Use a Continuous Integration and Deployment. (CI/CD pipeline)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="which-patterns-were-encountered">Which patterns were encountered?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Knowledge Tunnelling</li>
  <li>Failing Rigidity</li>
  <li>(Data Model Bypass)</li>
</ul>
