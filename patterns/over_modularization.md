# Over-Modularization âœ…
*Author: Andreas, Theo, Christian, Felix*
## Description
Software projects are divided into several modules at run time (e.g. services, lambdas) or build time (e.g. Maven modules, packages). This modularization has disadvantages compared to a modularization into fewer modules. It adds *unnecessary* complexity. Therefore, the project becomes harder to understand and debug for developers. Over-Modularization could lead to higher compile times. Additionally, the performance at run time could be inferior compared to a modularization into fewer modules.


## What are some examples?
- Cutting Maven modules or packages too small.
- Cutting microservices/nanoservices/lambdas too small.
- Temporal coupling of modules.


## Why does this happen?
- premature optimization:
    - Developers plan a modularization that will be ideal in the future.
    - The modules are supposed to provide a better build-performance/maintainability/testability in the future.
    - The modules could be reused in the future.
    - Developers are afraid that a further modularization at a later time will be difficult.
- [Cargo-Culting] : Developers modularize software because others do, without understanding why.
- Developers made bad experiences with Under-Modularization.
- Developers lack domain knowledge.


## How can we avoid getting into the situation in the first place?
- Try to have few meaningful modules which emphasize important architectural boundaries. Cut your modules by bounded contexts. (Domain-driven Design)
- [Yagni] : Don't split your project into more modules until you need to.
- Reevaluate the project's modularization periodically and refactor your software accordingly. Start early, later will be harder.


## What are suggestions to get out of the situation if we ended up in it?
- Develop a target modularization based on the current problems and experience. Compare it to the current modularization.
- Refactor modules based on the evaluation of the modularization.
- Merge modules which are usually deployed/modified together.
